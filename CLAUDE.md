# Claude Instructions for RoboClaw Project

## Project Overview

**RoboClaw** is a deployment system for OpenClaw instances. The primary tool is **clawctl**, a Node.js CLI (TypeScript) that deploys OpenClaw to remote servers via SSH and Docker.

**Key Facts:**
- **Language:** TypeScript (ES Modules)
- **Current Version:** v1.0.1
- **Status:** Production-ready, actively maintained
- **Distribution:** npm package (`npx clawctl`)

## Working with This Project

### When You DON'T Have a Concrete Task

**If the user asks a question or you need to understand the codebase:**

1. **Read the Navigation Guide First:** `.llm/NAVIGATION.md`
   - This routing document will tell you which spec(s) to read
   - It contains a quick routing table, topic index, and query examples
   - Reading this first saves time vs. reading all specs

2. **Then Read the Relevant Spec(s):**
   - `specs/clawctl-spec.md` - Technical implementation
   - `specs/clawctl-cli-spec.md` - CLI interface
   - `specs/docker-openclaw.md` - Docker containerization
   - `specs/clawctl-strategy.md` - Strategic direction
   - `specs/openclaw-architecture.md` - OpenClaw system architecture
   - `specs/testing-guide.md` - Testing and development guide
   - `specs/troubleshooting-guide.md` - Deployment troubleshooting
   - `specs/deployment-workflow.md` - Legacy Ansible (historical only)

3. **Check Project Memory:** `~/.claude/projects/-home-justin-Documents-RoboClaw/memory/MEMORY.md`
   - Contains lessons learned and common issues
   - Updated with implementation notes and gotchas

### When You DO Have a Concrete Task

**If the user asks you to implement, fix, or modify something:**

1. **Read relevant code files directly** (don't read specs unless you need context)
2. **Consult specs only if:**
   - You need to understand overall architecture
   - You're implementing a new feature
   - You're debugging something complex
   - You need to verify design decisions

3. **Always check memory** for previous notes on similar work

## Specification Usage Guidelines

### Read Specs When:
- ✅ User asks "how does X work?"
- ✅ User asks for explanation or documentation
- ✅ You're planning a new feature
- ✅ You need to understand deployment phases
- ✅ You're uncertain about architecture
- ✅ You need context for debugging
- ✅ User asks about OpenClaw (what it is, how it works)
- ✅ You need to test changes safely
- ✅ Deployment fails and you need troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ You're working with Gateway API or device pairing

### DON'T Read Specs When:
- ❌ User asks you to fix a specific bug (read the code instead)
- ❌ User points to a specific file (read that file)
- ❌ User asks you to implement a small feature (read relevant modules)
- ❌ You already understand what to do (just do it)

### Efficient Spec Reading:
1. **Start with `.llm/NAVIGATION.md`** - Find the right spec(s)
2. **Read targeted sections** - Use the topic index
3. **Cross-reference as needed** - Specs link to each other
4. **Update memory** - Note any discrepancies or learnings

## Key Technical Patterns

### ES Modules with TypeScript
```typescript
// Import statements MUST include .js extensions
import { foo } from './bar.js'  // Correct
import { foo } from './bar'     // Wrong
```

### Docker Compose Variable Substitution
```typescript
// Preserve ${VARIABLE} syntax in docker-compose.yml
const template = `user: "\${USER_UID}:\${USER_GID}"`  // Use escaped $

// .env file provides actual values
// USER_UID=1000
// USER_GID=1000

// Docker Compose substitutes at runtime: user: "1000:1000"
```

### Template Literals with Preserved Variables
```typescript
// Use String.raw or escape $ to prevent TypeScript substitution
String.raw`version: '3.8'
services:
  service:
    user: "${USER_UID}:${USER_GID}"
`
// Output contains ${USER_UID} literally, NOT substituted by TypeScript
```

### State Management
- Remote state file: `/home/roboclaw/.clawctl-deploy-state.json`
- Tracks deployment progress
- Enables idempotent resume on failure

### Deployment User
- Dedicated `roboclaw` user (UID 1000) created on remote server
- SSH user is `root` (required for Docker installation)
- Containers run as roboclaw UID for non-root security

## Common Operations

### Building the CLI
```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run watch          # Watch mode for development
npm run clean          # Remove dist/
```

### Running Locally
```bash
node dist/index.js deploy <IP> --key <path>
```

### Testing
```bash
# Requires real Ubuntu 24.04 VPS
npx clawctl deploy <IP> --key <path> --verbose

# See testing-guide.md for:
# - Test server setup
# - Testing workflows
# - Debugging techniques
# - Platform-specific testing
```

## Error Handling Principles

1. **Fail Fast, Fail Clearly** - Provide actionable error messages
2. **Idempotent Operations** - Safe to retry any phase
3. **State Tracking** - Resume from failure point automatically
4. **Exit Codes** - Each phase has specific exit code (0-10)

---

## Important Reminders

### TypeScript Errors
- **Error callbacks:** Use `(err: Error) =>` for typed callbacks
- **Unused imports:** Remove or use `import type` for types
- **Private properties:** Make public if needed externally

### Template Literal Issues
- **Problem:** `${VAR}` in template strings gets substituted by TS
- **Solution:** Use `\${VAR}` to escape, produces `${VAR}` in output
- **Example:** `` `user: "\${USER_UID}"` `` outputs `user: "${USER_UID}"`

### Memory Updates
When you encounter:
- Common errors or gotchas
- Implementation patterns that work well
- Things that need to be done differently
- Lessons learned

**Update the memory file** so future sessions benefit.
